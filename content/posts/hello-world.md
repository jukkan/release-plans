We have deployed a Hugo website!ðŸš€ Well, I have, at least.

Since I figured it might be useful to have the ability to post updates here about changes to the Release Plans Visualized report, I wanted to have a lightweight, static website with a posts feature. I ended up installing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and picking the [PaperMod template](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).

After some trial error, lots of discussion with ChatGPT and some Git struggles, I was able to get a seemingly working site pushed to my GitHub repo. Finally, I used Netlify to get the site publicly visible for all of you to access. The following video tutorial is a good reference in case you want to follow the same path as I did:
