We have deployed a Hugo website!ðŸš€ Well, I have, at least.

Since I figured it might be useful to have the ability to post updates here about changes to the Release Plans Visualized report, I wanted to have a lightweight, static website with a posts feature. I ended up installing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and picking the [PaperMod template](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).
